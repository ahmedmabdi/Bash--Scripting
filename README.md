# Bash Scripting Journey (CoderCo + Battle Bash Arena)

Welcome to my Bash scripting learning project! This repository documents my progress through the **Bash Scripting module at CoderCo** and my hands-on challenge with the **Battle Bash Arena (BBA)** — a game featuring 15 progressively harder Bash scripting problems.

## What I Learned at CoderCo

Through the Bash scripting module, I mastered the following:

- Navigating and scripting in the terminal
- Working with variables, arrays, and control flow (if, loops, case)
- Creating, reading, and writing files
- Using functions and exit codes
- String and pattern manipulation with wildcards and regex
- System utilities (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, etc.)
- Process and job control
- Handling command-line arguments and user input

## Battle Bash Arena (BBA)

After finishing the theory and practice at CoderCo, I took on the **Battle Bash Arena** — a 15-level game to test and solidify my Bash scripting skills.

Each level presents a challenge that must be solved using a Bash script. I’ve created a separate file for each level in the `BBA_Game/` folder.

✅ All 15 levels completed!
